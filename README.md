# PureEngage Workspace Web on Electron

## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app in development mode
npm start
```

Development mode is enabled when the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`. When enabled, development mode:
- Enables default menu bar, useful for reloads.
- Opens Developer Tools automatically from start.
- Enables BrowserWindow nodeIntegration. This enables testing native features fvrom the developer console easily.
