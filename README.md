## To Use

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
# Run the app in development mode

When enabled, development mode:
- Enables default menu bar, useful for reloads.
